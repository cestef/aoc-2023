# aoc-2023

My first year solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), this project is using the wonderful helper [cargo-aoc](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc).

## Running

First, make sure you have `cargo-aoc` installed.

```bash
cargo install cargo-aoc
```

You can then run the project with

```bash
cargo aoc
```

## Submitting

I recommend using [aoc-cli](https://github.com/scarvalhojr/aoc-cli) to submit your answers for AoC
